# F1Tool-Public
 A quick script I made for a tool to use with the F1-2021 game

# Why to use:
Use this in practice to figure out your strategy for the race, I usually do 2/3 laps with this running to get the data. You are limited by your skill to drive consistent laps and how far you can stretech your ERS without running out of battery for increasing your laps.

The included strategy.txt is from bahrain where I was in the Red Bull, driving pretty aggresively, using a fair bit of ERS and lapping around a 1:28:7 

# Usage:
Open a terninal in the main directory
install the requirted packages: ```pip install -r .\requirements.txt```

run the program: ```python .\src\main.py```
